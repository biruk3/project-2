# project-2
For the start we have to upload the random words given so that we can choose the words from them. 
Second we ask to print the encrypted words (the random words given)
Then we set how many tries is allwoed which is 10 
Then we classify what will happen if the user failed which is it will show wrong 
If the user chooses correct we print correct. 
Then at the last if the user uses all the 10 tries it will be game lost. 
Howver if the player guessed all the right players it is game won.
